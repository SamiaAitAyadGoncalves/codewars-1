## What is codewars.com?
codewars.com is a site, where you can rank up by doing programming tasks called katas. Many different programming languages are available and its a lot of fun!


## What will you find in this repository?
Here i will upload all my completed challenges.

There is a folder for each programming language containing folders for the different ranks. 8kyu is the lowest rank and therefore the challenges in the '8kyu' folder are the easiest.


## Caveat
Please keep in mind that my solutions show my journey learning python and other languages. Some codes might not be very efficient oder short.

My code is not intended for cheating. It is just my personal attempt to solve the challenges.
